A police drama based on real **organized** crime cases is helping educate the public about the value of the rule of law and their **rights**, experts said.

A special **campaign** launched by the central government on fighting organized crime and legal departments' **rectification** measures are used as much of the background for *The Knockout*.

The drama tells the story of a police officer's fight against organized crime over 20 years, and shows the rise and **demise** of **underworld** figures and corrupt officials.

It has received a rating of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, one of China's most-visited review platforms, and has become one of the most discussed topics on social media since mid-January. The drama began screening on China Central Television and streaming platform iQiyi on Jan 14, with a total of 39 **episodes** to be aired.

Many viewers have **applauded** the show's **plotlines** and the actors' performances, and also praised the efforts of police officers in battling organized crime.

In January 2018, the central **authorities** launched a three-year **nationwide** special campaign to fight organized crime.

According to the **Commission** for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central **Committee**, from 2018 to 2020, authorities busted 3,644 **mafia-like** gangs and 11,675 other criminal gangs, **detained** 237,000 **suspects** and investigated 89,700 cases of "protective umbrellas", a reference to officials who hide gangsters' crimes.

The **crackdown** on organized crime, which **involved** multiple departments including public security and **discipline** inspection, as well as banks, continued after the campaign **officially** ended.

In May 2022, the Anti-organized Crime Law took effect, giving greater legal **clout** to fight such crimes.

From July 2020 to December 2021, commissions for political and legal **affairs** at all levels also conducted educational **rectification** for officials in public security organs and **procuratorates** as well as lawyers and other related groups to strengthen internal supervision and **root out** those who **undermine** trust in the departments.

Wei Pengju, director of the Institute of Cultural Economics at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, said The Knockout **resonated** with viewers on an emotional level. Reactions to the program also reflected how the public perceived the work and achievements of the nation in combating organized crime and building a sound legal environment.

It educated viewers to have a positive attitude on seeking help through legal **avenues**, rather than violence or bullying, when encountering unfairness, Wei said. The program also **deterred** potential gangsters from **pursuing** criminal activities.

"Stories of fighting organized crime are often attractive to audiences, and this reflects people's expectations and trust in advancing rule of law. The **hatred** of gangsters and the pursuit of justice among viewers is the same, which is the simplest understanding of a law-based society," said Zhi Feina, a professor at the Film and Television Research Institute of the Chinese National **Academy** of Arts.

Zhi said that the positive sentiment created by the authorities' crackdown on organized crime is an important reason for the drama's success. This has also **promoted** the idea of the rule of law, she added.
